\section{The Derived Category of Motives}\label{sect_dmeff_and_dm}

In this section, we define the derived category of motives $\DMeff$,
and show that it is equipped with a closed monoidal structure that
will be used to construct the slice filtration in Section 
\ref{sect_slice_filt_dm}.

To do this, we first define the bounded above derived category 
$\DCat^-\ShCor$ of Nisnevich sheaves, and define $\DMeff$ to be
the localization of $\DCat^-\ShCor$ by a class of morphisms in
$\DCat^-\ShCor$ called $\A^1$-weak equivalence. We then show that
$\DMeff$ is in fact equivalent as a category to the subcategory
of $\DCat^-\ShCor$ with homotopy invariant cohomology. 

We also show that $\DCat^-\PST$ is equipped with a symmetric 
closed monoidal structure, and the tensor and internal hom on
$\DCat^-\PST$ induce a symmetric closed monoidal structure on
$\DMeff$. For the remainder of the section, unless stated 
otherwise, all sheaves are Nisnevich sheaves. We will drop the 
``Nis'', and simply write $\ShCor$ for the category of Nisnevich 
sheaves with transfers.

First consider the category $\PST$. By Yoneda, for $X \in \Sm$ and
$F \in \PST$,
\[
\hom_{\PST}(\Ztr(X), F) = F(X).
\]
It follows that $\Ztr(X)$ is projective for every $X \in \Sm$.
Since direct sums of projectives are projective, 
$\oplus_i \Ztr(X_i)$ is also projective for any arbitrary 
collection $\{Z_i\}$. Furthermore, for $F \in \PST$, there exists 
a surjection
\begin{equation}\label{eq_res_by_rep}
\bigoplus_{X} \bigoplus_{0 \neq x \in F(X)} \Ztr(X) 
   \stackrel{x}{\to} F.
\end{equation}
Hence, the category $\PST$ has enough projectives. Thus, we may 
define the bounded above derived category $\DCat[D]^-\PST$ of the 
abelian category $\PST$, and a closed monoidal structure on 
$\DCat[D]^-\PST$. The existence of $\DCat[D]^-\PST$ follows from 
\cite[Thm. 10.4.8]{WH} 10.4.8.

Similarly, we define the bounded derived category $\DCat^- \ShCor$
of Nisnevich sheaves with transfers. Notice, in particular, $\ShCor$
has enough injectives (\cite[Thm. 13.1]{MVW}), and once again by 
\cite[Thm. 10.4.8]{WH}, we can define $\DCat^-\ShCor$ as the homotopy
category $\DCat[K]^-$ of bounded above complex of injective objects
in $\ShCor$. 

To simplify notations, for the remainder, we write $\DShCor$ for 
the derived category $\DCat^-\ShCor$ of Nisnevich sheaves with 
transfers. We now define $\DMeff$, the derived category of 
motives. To do so, we first need a notion of a thick subcategory.

\begin{defn}
A full additive subcategory $\Cat{W}$ of a derived category 
$\DCat$ is \DEF{thick} if it satisfies the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item if $A \to B \to C \to A[1]$ is a distinguished triangle, then
any two of $A, B, C$ is in $\Cat{W}$, then so is the third.

\item if $A$ and $B$ are objects in $\Cat{W}$, then $A \oplus B \in
\Cat{W}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

If $\Cat{W}$ is a thick subcategory of a derived category $\DCat$,
then we can define a quaotient triangulated category 
$\DCat/\Cat{W}$. Let $\Cat{S}$ be the set of maps whose cone is in 
$\Cat{W}$. Then $\Cat{S}$ is a saturated multiplicative system in 
the sense that $\Cat{S}$ contains the identity, is closed under 
composition, and if $fg \in \Cat{S}$, then $f$ and $g$ are both in 
$\Cat{S}$. Define $\DCat/\Cat{W}$ to be the localization 
$\DCat[D] [\Cat{S}^{-1}]$.

\begin{defn}\label{def_DMeff}
Let $\Cat{W}_{\A}$ be the thick subcategory of $\DCat^-$ generated 
by the cones of $\Ztr(X \times \A^1) \to \Ztr(X)$ for every $X \in 
\Sm$, closed under direct sums that exist in $\DCat^-\ShCor$. 
Write $\Cat{S}_{\A}$ for the maps whose cone is in $\Cat{W}_{\A}$. 
We say $f \in \DShCor$ is an \DEF{$\A^1$-weak equivalence} if $f 
\in \Cat{S}_{\A}$.

We write $\DMeff$ for the localization 
$\DShCor [\Cat{S}_{\A}^{-1}]$. The category that we have
just defined is the derived category of motives.
\end{defn}

While we have defined $\DMeff$ as a localization of 
$\DCat^-$ by the $\A^1$-weak equivalences, we can identify
$\DMeff$ with a subcategory of $\DShCor$.

\begin{defn}
Let $F^* \in \DShCor$. We say that $F^*$ is \DEF{$\A^1$-local} if
$\hom_{\DShCor}(-, F^*)$ sends $\A^1$-weak equivalences to 
isomorphisms. We write $\ALocal$ for the full subcategory of 
$\A^1$-local objects in $\DShCor$.
\end{defn}

% define suslin C^*
\begin{defn}
For $F^*$ a bounded above complex of sheaves with transfers,
let $G^{*,*}$ denote the double complex $G^{p, q} = 
\suslC[p] F^q$. The total complex $\Tot G^{*,*}$ is an object
of $\DShCor$, which we write as $\suslC F^*$. 
\end{defn}
