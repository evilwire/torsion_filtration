\section{The Derived Category of Motives}\label{sect_dmeff_and_dm}


\begin{defn}
Let $F \in \HI$. Let $\RHI{F}$ denote presheaf given by
\[
U \mapsto \cok\big( F(U \times \A^1) \to 
   F(U \times (\A^1 - 0))\big).
\]
We write $\RHI[(n + 1)]{F}$ for $\RHI{(\RHI[n]{F})}$. We call 
$\RHI{F}$ the contraction of $F$.
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}\label{prop_contract_is_exact}
The association $F \mapsto \RHI{F}$ is an exact functor from
the category of $\HI$ to $\HI$. (see \cite{MVW} Lecture 23, and
\cite{DegGenMot} Prop. 3.4.3)
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
The inclusion of $X \simeq X \times \{1\}$ into $X \times 
(\A^1 - 0)$ induces a splitting
\[
F(X) \oplus \RHI{F}(X).
\]
It follows that $\RHI{F}$ is also homotopy invariant. Moreover,
if $F$ is a sheaf, then so is $\RHI{F}$.

Assume that we have an exact sequence of homotopy invariant 
sheaves
\[
0 \to F' \to F \to F'' \to 0.
\]
Write $\tilde{F}$ for the sheaf given by $U \mapsto F(U \times 
(\A^1 - 0))$.

By the Snake Lemma, it suffices to prove that
\[
0 \to \tilde{F}' \to \tilde{F} \to \tilde{F}'' \to 0
\]
is exact. For exactness, it suffices to show that the above 
sequence is exact at a Hensel local scheme $S$. That is, for
Hensel local scheme $S$

\end{proof}
