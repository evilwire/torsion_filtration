\section{Homotopy Invariant Sheaves with Transfers}\label{sect_hist}

Let $\basefield$ be a perfect field, and let $\Sm$ denote the 
category of smooth separated finite type $\basefield$-schemes.

\begin{defn}\label{def_cor}
Let $X, Y \in \Sm$. An \DEF{elementary correspondence from $X$ to 
$Y$} is an irreducible closed subset $W$ of $X \times Y$ such that 
the projection to $X$ from the associated integral subscheme $W$
is finite and surjective.

Let \DEF{$\Cor(X, Y)$} denote the free abelian group generated by 
the elementary correspondences from $X$ to $Y$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
The \DEF{category $\Cor$ of finite correspondences} has as objects 
the smooth finite-type $\basefield$-schemes, such that the 
morphisms between any two objects $X$ and $Y$ is $\Cor(X, Y)$.
\end{defn}

In this section, we introduce the 
category of homotopy invariant sheaves with transfers beginning 
with the notion of correspondences
