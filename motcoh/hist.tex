Let $\basefield$ be a perfect field, and let $\Sm$ denote the 
category of smooth separated finite type $\basefield$-schemes.

\begin{defn}\label{def_cor}
Let $X, Y \in \Sm$. An \DEF{elementary correspondence from $X$ to 
$Y$} is an irreducible closed subset $W$ of $X \times Y$ such that 
the projection to $X$ from the associated integral subscheme 
$\Sch{W}$ is finite and surjective.

Let \DEF{$\Cor(X, Y)$} denote the free abelian group generated by 
the elementary correspondences from $X$ to $Y$. Elements of 
$\Cor(X, Y)$ are called \DEF{finite correspondences from $X$ to 
$Y$}.
\end{defn}

Let $\Cor_{\basefield}$ be a collection of objects and morphisms 
where the objects are those of $\Sm$ and morphism between any 
$X, Y \in \Cor_{\basefield}$ is given by $\Cor(X, Y)$. We claim
that $\Cor_{\basefield}$ form a category. The main missing piece 
here is to the composition of morphisms. This is achieved by 
pulling back correspondences as given by the following lemma:

%
% show that correspondences can be composed
%
\begin{lem}\label{lem_cor_composition}
Let $V \in \Cor(X, Y)$ and $W \in \Cor(Y, Z)$ be elementary 
correspondences. Writing
\[
V = \sum_i n_i V_i, \;\;textrm{and}\;\; W = \sum_j m_i W_i
\]
where $V_i$ and $W_j$ are elementary correspondences, then
\[
V \circ W = \sum_{i, j} n_im_j \Sch{V_i} \times_Y \Sch{W_j}
\]
define a finite correspondence from $X$ to $Z$.
\end{lem}
