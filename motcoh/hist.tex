\section{Homotopy Invariant Sheaves with Transfers}\label{sect_hist}

Let $\basefield$ be a perfect field, and let $\Sm$ denote the 
category of smooth separated finite type $\basefield$-schemes.

\begin{defn}\label{def_cor}
Let $X, Y \in \Sm$. An \DEF{elementary correspondence from $X$ to 
$Y$} is an irreducible closed subset $W$ of $X \times Y$ such that 
the projection to $X$ from the associated integral subscheme 
$\Sch{W}$ is finite and surjective.

Let \DEF{$\Cor(X, Y)$} denote the free abelian group generated by 
the elementary correspondences from $X$ to $Y$. Elements of 
$\Cor(X, Y)$ are called \DEF{finite correspondences from $X$ to 
$Y$}.
\end{defn}

We claim that $\Cor_{\basefield}$, whose objects are those of $\Sm$
whereby morphism between any $X, Y \in \Sm$ is given by $\Cor(X, Y)$
form a category. The main missing piece here is to show that one
can compose two finite correspondences. This is achieved by pulling
back correspondences:

% show that correspondences can be composed

\begin{lem}\label{lem_cor_composition}
Let $V \in \Cor(X, Y)$ and $W \in \Cor(Y, Z)$ be elementary 
correspondences. Writing
\[
V = \sum_i n_i V_i, \;\;textrm{and}\;\; W = \sum_j m_i W_i
\]
where $V_i$ and $W_j$ are elementary correspondences, then
\[
V \circ W = \sum_{i, j} n_im_j \Sch{V_i} \times_Y \Sch{W_j}
\]
define a finite correspondence from $X$ to $Z$.
\end{lem}

\begin{defn}
The \DEF{category $\Cor$ of finite correspondences} has as objects 
the smooth finite-type $\basefield$-schemes, such that the 
morphisms between any two objects $X$ and $Y$ is $\Cor(X, Y)$.
\end{defn}
