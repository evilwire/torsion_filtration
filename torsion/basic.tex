\section{Coradicals and Torsion Theory}\label{sect_torsion_theory}

In this section, we develop the basics of torsion theory in a 
categorical setting. The concepts and results here closely follow
those of \cite{BJV} and \cite{DTor}, except we develop the theory
from the dual perspective of the coradicals. 

Recall that an abelian category $\Cat{A}$ is \emph{well-powered} 
if for every object $A \in \Cat{A}$, the collection of subobjects 
of $A$ form a set. For the following, let $\Cat{A}$ be a 
well-powered
