\section{Filtration on $\HI$}\label{sect_filtration_hi}

Recall that a weak filtration of a category $\Cat{C}$ is a tower 
of subcategories
\[
\cdots \subset F_n\Cat{C} \subset F_{n - 1}\Cat{C} \subset \cdots 
   \subset \Cat{C}
\]
together with reflection functors $f_n : \Cat{C} \to F_n\Cat{C}_n$
(cf. \ref{def_cat_filtration}.) If we have a suitable notion of
subobjects in $\Cat{C}$, e.g. if $\Cat{C}$ is abelian, we can 
define a stronger notion (as the name suggests).

For the remainder, let $\Cat{C}$ be an abelian category. We have:

\begin{defn}
We say that a filtration $(\Cat{C}, f_*)$ is \emph{strong} if for
each $A \in \Cat{C}$ and $n \in \Z$, $f_n A$ is a subobject of 
$A$. Similarly a cofiltration $(\Cat{C}, c_*)$ is a \emph{strong} 
if $c_n A$ is a quotient of $A$ for each $n$.
\end{defn}

The purpose of this section and the next is to construct a 
strong filtration on the category $\CycMod$. To do this, we first
construct a weak filtration structure on $\HI$ using a pair
of adjoint functors obtained from the closed symmetric monoidal 
structure of $\HI$. 

Recall that the sheaf $\Ox$ of units given by 
\[
\Ox(X) = \{\textrm{invertible elements of }\O(X)\}
\]
is a homotopy invariant sheaf with transfers. For $F \in \HI$, 
set
\[
\LHI{F} = F \tHI \Ox \hspace{10pt} \textrm{and}\hspace{10pt} 
   \RHI{F} = \ihomHI(\Ox, F).  
\]
We write $\LHI[n]{F}$ for the $n$-th iteration of the functor
$\LHI{-}$ on $F$, and similarly $\RHI[n]{F}$ for the $n$-th 
iteration of $\RHI{?}$ on $F$.

\begin{rmk}
In writing $\RHI{F}$ 
In literature, the notation $\RHI{F}$ is often used to represent
the contraction of $F$, which is the sheaf that sends $X \in 
\Cor$ to $\cok( F(X \times \A^1) \to F(X \times (\A^1 - 0))).$
\end{rmk}
