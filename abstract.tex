\abstract{We show that the category $\HI$ of homotopy invariant 
Nisnevich sheaves with transfers and the category $\CycMod$ are 
each equipped with a strong filtrations and a strong cofiltration.
To do so, we first define pre-coradicals and coradicals on 
well-powered abelian categories, and show that every isomorphism 
class of coradical is associated to a canonical torsion theory. We 
then summarize the theory of motivic cohomology needed to define 
$\HI$, its symmetric 
monoidal structure $\tHI$ and its partial internal hom $\ihomHI$. 
Along the way, we recall the construction of the slice filtration 
on $\DMeff$, and extend the filtration structure on $\DMeff$ to 
$\DM$. 

We then define and construct the torsion filtration on $\HI$ by 
constructing a sequence of coradicals. We explain how the torsion
filtration is related to the slice filtration on $\DMeff$. We 
extend the torsion filtration to the category $\HM$ of homotopic 
modules. Appealing to the categorical equivalence between $\HM$ 
and $\CycMod$, we obtain the torsion filtration on $\CycMod$. 
Finally, we generalize the conditions under which torsion 
filtrations exist for the heart of a tensor triangulated 
category.}
